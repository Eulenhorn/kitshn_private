Yet another (mostly) bug fix release:

1. Fixed crash when opening meal plan page on iOS (#282).
   - This is a very quick fix, which disables all date pickers on iOS.
2. Fixed social media import failing when sharing link to kitshn without default AI provider.
3. Improved decimal to fraction conversion (#281).
