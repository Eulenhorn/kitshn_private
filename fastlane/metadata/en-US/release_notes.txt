One release never comes alone!
So here is the cleanup of the mess that v2.0.0-beta.11.1 caused:

1. Fixed copy, cut and paste not working on iOS and iPadOS (#273).
2. Fixed crash when using social media import twice.
3. Fixed social media import of TikTok videos not working (#276).
4. Fixed session timeout issue when using social media import.
5. Fixed url not being set as sourceUrl value of recipe when using social media import.
6. Added better image fetching for Instagram posts (previously included play arrow overlay for reels).
